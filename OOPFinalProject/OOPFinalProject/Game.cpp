As the door closes behind you its eyes snap open, and it smiles at you.",

She stares at you with a level, guarded gaze without stopping (or even slowing) her calculations on the abacus. You can just barely hear her mumbling to herself as she counts.",

As you examine the contents of the room more closely you notice that the newspaper clippings scattered around are all of famous tragedies.
